# Increasing-the-efficiency-of-person-recognition

This project is a part of my diploma thesis.

I proposed an approach of improving the efficiency of face recognition in images with artificial neural network. This approach allows to reduce the amount of stored information and increase the correctness of the data array. 

It is proposed to explore the graph with vertices corresponding to the feature vectors. The vertices of the graph describing the same person are replaced by the dominating set. In order to achieve it, algorithms for finding a polynomial approximation for the minimum dominating set are applied. 

Various experiments were executed on LFW dataset.
